<h1>Recommended articles</h1>

Here I collect research and survey articles that I read/want to read that are exceptionally interesting.

<ul>
<li>
<b><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9404236">On Proof and Progress in Mathematics</a></b><br />
Interesting and well-written thought about different aspects of how it is to be a mathematican, what is a proof, how mathematicians think, et cetera. Really worth a read.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183554173"><b>
"The structure of algebraic threefolds: an introduction to Mori's program", János Kollár</b>
</a><br />
Good introductory text about the classification of threefolds. Its focus is on ideas and not on proofs. I skipped last part.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2001-38-04/S0273-0979-01-00913-2/S0273-0979-01-00913-2.pdf"><b>"A mad day's work: From Grothendieck to Connes and Kontsevich. The evolution of concepts of space and symmetry", Pierre Cartier</b></a><br />
A short biographical sketch of Grothendieck together with connections between functional analysis, algebraic geometry and theoretical physics. Very interesting.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2004-41-03/S0273-0979-04-01024-9/S0273-0979-04-01024-9.pdf"><b>"Perturbations, deformations and variations (and "near-misses") in geometry, physics, and number theory", B. Mazur</b></a><br />

Very fun read about how the concept of "deformation" and "stability" shows up in different areas of mathematics.
</li>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0408099v1"><b>"Tropical Mathematics", D. Spayer, B. Sturmfels</b></a><br />
A short and very readable introduction to tropical mathematics and applications, with lots of references.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2002-39-02/S0273-0979-01-00934-X/home.html"><b>"The octonions", J. Baez</b></a><br />
A survey article on the octonions with lots of connections to other parts of mathematics, including physics. <i>Very</i> interesting read.
</li>

<li><a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-0348-8268-2_20"><b>Stacks for everybody, Barbara Fantechi</b></a><br />
Stacks (or "stabler" in Norwegian) are extremely abstract, and this article does an excellent job of explaining them without being too technical.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2010-47-03/S0273-0979-10-01295-4/S0273-0979-10-01295-4.pdf"><b>Today's menu: geometry and resolution of singular algebraic surfaces</b></a><br />
An illustrated guide to resolution of algebraic surfaces with lots of explanations and references. Fantastic reading.
